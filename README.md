# WebExBot
This is a POC of WebEx Bot that you can use it in the enterprise to help you resolve lots of tasks. You can develop it by yourself and based on your company business scenario.
In this POC, I just built 3 modules:
-  Qualys Assets - you can query a hostname and the bot will return the vulnerabilities CSV file to you.
-  Release Emails - you can release Encrypted Email from quarantine from the Cisco SMA.
-  Certificates - you can generate client certificates from your enterprise CA server and use a random password to encrypt it as an PFX file and send it by email.
